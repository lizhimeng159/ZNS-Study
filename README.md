# ZNS-Study
ZNS Study running scripts, plotting scripts, and data collection

// TODO add instructions how to setup the namespaces, or make a script to do it and fill the cold data one already.

// TODO: add instructions on the benchmarks, what benchmark is what, which directory contains which benchmark (relate to sections in paper)

// TODO: Warning that namespaces are formatted, hence wrong input will result in data loss on the namespace

// TODO: Our configuration (what device is which, what figures/data is what we use for the paper, etc.)

// TODO: requirements, nvme-cli, blkzone, libzbd, fio, kernel 5.9+ (others?)

// TODO: Running the actual benchmark, also mention the get info script for zoned info
